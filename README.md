#  Global Health Analysis (2000–2025)

This project presents a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of global health indicators across the years 2000 to 2025. It explores key metrics such as recovery and mortality rates, the burden of diseases, healthcare infrastructure, and socioeconomic influences across continents and selected countries.

##  Project Overview

The objective of this study is to uncover patterns and disparities in global health outcomes and infrastructure over a 25-year period. The analysis is segmented by regions and focuses on understanding the impact of disease burden, access to care, and urbanization on recovery and mortality.

##  Objectives

- Analyze trends in global recovery and mortality rates.
- Identify the most burdensome diseases using DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years).
- Examine the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health outcomes.
- Provide actionable recommendations for health system improvements globally.

---

##  Data Source

- Aggregated datasets from WHO, regional health ministries, and public international health reports.
- Period analyzed: **2000–2025**
- Geographical scope: Global (with focus on Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania)

---

##  Tools Used

- **Microsoft PowerPoint** – Final presentation
- **Excel** – Data cleaning & preliminary aggregations
- **Power BI** – Dashboard visualization
- **DAX**

---

##  Data Cleaning

- Standardized time formats and removed duplicates.
- Normalized country and regional names.
- Interpolated missing DALY and incidence data.
- Verified KPI values for accuracy using cross-sources.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis

- Recovery and mortality trend analysis by 5-year intervals.
- Bubble plots for disease incidence vs. DALY burden.
- Regional analysis: income, urbanization, doctor density.
- Identification of outliers and anomalies in disease prevalence.

---

##  Data Insights

- **Recovery Rate:** Averaged 74.5%; surges noted in 2000–2005 and 2011–2015.
- **Mortality Rate:** Gradual rise from 5.0% to 5.1% despite increased access.
- **Top Diseases (by DALY):** COVID-19, Asthma, HIV/AIDS, Cancer, Diabetes.
- **Chronic and Metabolic Diseases:** Represent highest long-term impact globally.
- **Urbanization & Healthcare:** High urbanization alone does not ensure better outcomes.

---

##  Key Findings

- Mortality remains high in some high-income regions due to aging and chronic illness.
- Some low-income regions (e.g., parts of Africa) show strong recovery rates due to targeted policies.
- Healthcare cost does not always correlate with better outcomes.
- Doctor-patient ratio remains a critical challenge in underserved regions.

---

##  Recommendations

- **Strengthen Health Workforce:** Invest in human capacity in low-density regions.
- **Tailor Interventions by Region:** Use DALY trends to drive funding and policy.
- **Integrate Urban Planning with Health Systems:** Especially in rapidly urbanizing countries.
- **Track Recovery Metrics:** Prioritize tracking recovery alongside mortality.
- **Use DALY in Policy Design:** As a strategic planning and budgeting tool.
